📊 Data Science Submission — Trader Behavioral Analysis
Author: Teerth Purohit
Date: December 2025
________________________________________
 Project Overview

This project investigates how market sentiment (Fear vs. Greed) influences real trading performance using:

Historical trade execution data (from Hyperliquid)

Bitcoin Fear & Greed sentiment index

The goal is to identify hidden behavioral patterns in profitability, capital efficiency, trade timing, and directional bias (BUY vs. SELL).

All analysis is implemented in Python using a Jupyter/Colab notebook with a fully reproducible workflow and no external database dependencies.

Setup Instructions
This notebook is designed to run without any external downloads, cloud connections, or Drive mounting.
All paths are relative to the project root.
Requirements
•	Python 3.10+
•	pandas
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
Installation (optional)
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
________________________________________
Running the Notebook
1.	Open notebook_1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or Google Colab.
2.	Ensure the current working directory is set using:
import os
os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/ds_Teerth_Purohit')
 If running locally:
You do not need to change directories as long as the folder structure remains the same.
3.	Run the notebook cells from top to bottom.
Summary tables will automatically be saved to /csv_files/ and charts saved to /outputs/.

 Data Sources & Notes
•	historical_data.csv contains trade-level execution data:
timestamp, direction (BUY/SELL), instrument, size (USD), fees, and realized PnL.
•	fear_greed_index.csv contains daily sentiment classification values:
Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, Extreme Greed.
•	Date alignment is performed using trade_date = date(timestamp).
This creates a clean one-to-many merge between sentiment and trade tables.
•	ROI is defined as:
ROI (%) = (Closed PnL / Position Size USD) * 100
________________________________________
Outputs & Interpretation
The notebook produces:
•	pnl_vs_mood.png — average profit by sentiment
•	strategy_dashboard.png — ROI, Win Rate, Buy Ratio & Avg Trade Size by sentiment
•	time_analysis.png — volume and win rate by day & hour
•	psychology_check.png — long vs short performance & top assets
These visualizations are referenced throughout ds_report.pdf.
